If you believe someone has violated the [Code of Conduct](/en/coc/), we encourage
you to report it. If you are unsure whether the incident is a violation, or
whether the space where it happened is covered by the Code of Conduct, we
encourage you to still report it. We are fine with receiving reports where we
decide to take no action for the sake of creating a safer space.

# General reporting procedure

The best way to contact the Code of Conduct team is by email at
[conference_conduct@pyladies.com](mailto:confernece_conduct@pyladies.com)
which is monitored by the Code of Conduct team
(Cecilia, Debbie, Jessica, Maaya, and Tania).

In case of a conflict of interest, you can individually contact:

* Tania Allard (tania@pyladies.com)
* Mariatta Wijaya (mariatta@pyladies.com)

# Report Data

When reporting an incident, please include as much information as possible,
including:

* Your contact info (so we can get in touch with you if we need to follow up)
* Date and time of the incident
* Location of incident
* Whether the incident is ongoing
* Description of the incident
* Identifying information of the reported person: name, screen name (Slack,
  Hubilo, etc.), physical appearance, height, clothing, voice accent,
  identifying information such as company name, or other information displayed
  on the conference platform.
* Additional circumstances surrounding the incident
* Other people involved in or witnesses to the incident and their contact information or description

# Confidentiality

**All reports will be kept confidential**. When we discuss incidents with people
who are reported, we will anonymize details as much as we can to protect
reporter privacy.


However, some incidents happen in one-on-one interactions, and even if the
details are anonymized, the reported person may be able to guess who made the
report. If you have concerns about retaliation or your personal safety, please
note those in your report. We still encourage you to report, so that we can
support you while keeping our conference attendees safe. In some cases, we can
compile several anonymized reports into a pattern of behavior, and take action
on that pattern.

In some cases, we may determine that a public statement will need to be made.
If thatâ€™s the case, the identities of all individuals involved and reporters
will remain confidential unless those individuals instruct us otherwise.

# Report handling procedure

When you make a report to an incident responder, they will gather information
about the incident according to the [Procedure For Incident
Reponse](/en/coc-enforcing/).

After an incident responder takes the report, they will immediately consult
with the CoC team, unless there is a conflict of interest, in which case any
non-interested parties will be contacted.

If the incident is ongoing and needs to be immediately addressed, any lead
incident responder may take appropriate action to ensure the safety of everyone
involved. If the situation requires it, this may take the form of a referral to
an appropriate non-PyLadiesCon agency, including the local police. The CoC team
is not equipped to handle emergency situations.

If the incident is less urgent, the report will be discussed by the CoC team,
who will meet to determine an appropriate response. Examples of possible
incident responses are outlined in the [Procedure For Incident
Response](/en/coc-enforcing).

Before the conference, the CoC team review the outlined procedures. After the
conference, all CoC team members will attend a debriefing session with the CoC
team chair to discuss all incidents and determine any necessary follow-up
actions.

# Following up with reporters

Within one week of an incident report, a member of the CoC team will follow up
with the person who made the report and provided their contact information. The
follow-up may include:

* An acknowledgment that the Code of Conduct team discussed the situation
* Whether or not the report was determined to be a violation of the Code of
  Conduct
* What actions (if any) were taken to correct the reported behavior

In some cases, the CoC team members may need to ask additional questions about
the incident in order to identify the reported person.

# Conflicts of interest

If an incident responder has a conflict of interest for a report, they will
recuse themselves from the discussion and handling of the incident. The
incident documentation will not be available to them, and they will excuse
themselves from any conversations involving handling the incident.

Should more than two members of the CoC lead responders need to recuse
themselves, another PyLadiesCon organizer will step in as a temporary lead
incident responder.
