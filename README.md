# PyLadiesCon 2025

This website uses [Astro](https://astro.build) as a framework,
and the theme is a fork from the [Astros](https://github.com/majesticooss/astros)
theme.

## Setup
First install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) if you don't have it already.

Then, run `pnpm install` and `pnpm dev` for installing dependencies and the
development mode to test locally.
